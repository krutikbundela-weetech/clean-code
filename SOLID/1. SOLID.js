/**
 * * *SOLID Pinciples
 * (all codes)
 * https://github.com/academind/clean-code-course-code/tree/obj-06-solid
 * 
 * *1. Single Responsibility Principle 
 *      classes  should have a single responsibility - a class should't change for more than one reason 
 *
 * *2. Open-Closed Principle
 *       A class should be open for extension but closed for modification
 *          (class ni under kai modifify nai thavu joie but extend thavu joie(inheritance , interface))
 * 
 * *3. Liskov Substitution Principle
 *      Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subclasses without altering the behavior.
 * 
 * *4. Interface Segregation Principle
 *      many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface
 * 
 * 
 * *5. Dependency Inversion Principle
 *      you should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

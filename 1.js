/**
 * ? What is clean code?
 * *   should be readable and meaningful
 * * should reduce cognitive load 
 * * should concise and "to the point"
 * * should avoid unintutive names, complex nesting and big code blocks
 * 
 * key pain points:
 * name: variables, functions, classes.
 * structure & comments : code formatting , good/bad comments
 * functions: length , parameters
 * conditionals & errors handling: deep nesting, missing error handling
 * classes & data structures missing distinction , bloated classes
